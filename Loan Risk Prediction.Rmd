```{r}
# Load the dataset
financial_df <- read.csv('financial_risk_assessment.csv')

# Get the structure of the dataset (data types and first few rows of each column)

Our dataset consists of 20 variables (columns) and 15,000 rows (observations).

The dataset contains two types of variables:

. Numerical variables: Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Years at Current Job, Debt-to-Income Ratio, Assets Value, Number of Dependents, Previous Defaults, Marital Status Change.

. Categorical variables: Gender, Education Level, Marital Status, Loan Purpose, Employment Status, Payment History, City, State, Country, Risk Rating.

but City, State, and Country variables are not relevant for risk prediction so we remove these variables.

## 1.2 Remove location based variables 
```{r}
financial_df <- financial_df[, !(names(financial_df) %in% c('City' , 'State', 'Country'))]
str(financial_df)
```
Now dataset consists of 17 variables (columns) and 15,000 rows (observations).

## 1.3 Data quality findings
```{r}
# Check for missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(financial_df))

sum(duplicated(financial_df))

# Frequency tables for categorical variables

table(financial_df$Gender)
table(financial_df$Education.Level)
table(financial_df$Marital.Status)
table(financial_df$Loan.Purpose)
table(financial_df$Employment.Status)
table(financial_df$Payment.History)
table(financial_df$Risk.Rating)
```



There are no missing values in the categorical variables, and they appear to be correctly formatted. However, some numerical columns contain missing values (NAâ€™s), affecting approximately 15% of the dataset. These missing values need to be cleaned before further analysis.

## 2 CLEANING + EDA(EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS)

# 2.1 check whether Data is skewed or not by using histogram and also check exact number 

```{r}

# Add mean line
abline(v=mean(financial_df$Credit.Score, na.rm=TRUE), 
       col="darkblue", lwd=2, lty=2)

       col="darkgreen", lwd=2, lty=3)
}

skewness(financial_df$Credit.Score, na.rm = TRUE)

abline(v=median(financial_df$Loan.Amount, na.rm=TRUE), 
       col="darkgreen", lwd=2, lty=3)
}

# Check the skewness of Loan.Amount in Numbers
skewness(financial_df$Loan.Amount, na.rm = TRUE)

######    Distribution of Assets.Value     #####
# More complete histogram with density curve
{
hist(financial_df$Assets.Value, 
     breaks=20, 
     probability=TRUE,

     main="Distribution of Assets.Value",
     xlab="Assets.Value")
lines(density(financial_df$Assets.Value,na.rm = TRUE), col="red", lwd=2)

# Add mean line
abline(v=mean(financial_df$Assets.Value, na.rm=TRUE), 
       col="darkblue", lwd=2, lty=2)

# Add median line
abline(v=median(financial_df$Assets.Value, na.rm=TRUE), 
       col="darkgreen", lwd=2, lty=3)
}

# Check the skewness of Assets.Value in Numbers
skewness(financial_df$Assets.Value, na.rm = TRUE)
```




Interpretation of skewness 
if it is == 0 that mean distribution is Normal, Not skewness
if it is > 0.5 or < -0.5 that mean distribution is Moderately skewed, 
if it is > 1 or < -1 that mean distribution is Highly skewed. 
Since all distributions are Normal means not skewed, Mean Imputation is recommended. If the distributions were skewed, Median Imputation would have been a better option.


```{r}
# Impute missing values with the mean for continuous variables
financial_df$Income[is.na(financial_df$Income)] <- mean(financial_df$Income, na.rm = TRUE)

financial_df$Credit.Score[is.na(financial_df$Credit.Score)] <- mean(financial_df$Credit.Score, na.rm = TRUE)

financial_df$Loan.Amount[is.na(financial_df$Loan.Amount)] <- mean(financial_df$Loan.Amount, na.rm = TRUE)

financial_df$Assets.Value[is.na(financial_df$Assets.Value)] <- mean(financial_df$Assets.Value, na.rm = TRUE)

```




Rather than applying basic mean or median imputation for the discrete variables such as Previous.Defaults and Number.of.Dependents, we opt for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation. This method enhances prediction accuracy and assists in uncovering more significant patterns in factors like age, income, and various financial indicators.

# 2.2 Apply KNN imputation on Previous.Defaults and Number.of.Dependents variables
```{r}
financial_df <- kNN(financial_df, variable = c('Previous.Defaults', 'Number.of.Dependents'), k=5)

# Remove the _imp indicator columns
financial_df <- financial_df[, !grepl("_imp", names(financial_df))]

# Display summary statistics after imputation
str(financial_df) 

colSums(is.na(financial_df))
```
# 2.3 Correlation Between features

## 2.3.1 Correlations between Numerical features 
```{r}
# Selecting only numerical columns for Linear corrleation
numeric_df <- financial_df[, sapply(financial_df, is.numeric)]

# Creating a correlation matrix and scatterplot matrix
{
psych::pairs.panels(numeric_df, 
                    method = "pearson",  # Correlation method
                    hist.col = "lightblue",  # Histogram color

                    pch = 21, bg = "lightgray",
                    col = "darkblue",
                    font.labels = 4,
                    gap = 0.4)     # Make labels bold-ish
title("Pairwise Correlation of Financial Features", line = 3, cex.main = 1)
}
```


## 2.3.2 Correlation between Target Variable with all numeric variables by using Spearman Correlation

Use Spearman Correlation by using Target variable(Risk.Rating) with all numerical variables to check how each feature influences the target variable(Risk.Rating). 

```{r}

# Convert Risk Rating to numeric for Spearman correlation 
risk_numeric <- as.numeric(financial_df$Risk.Rating)
# Compute Spearman correlation between Risk Rating and all numeric variables
Risk_correlations <- sapply(numeric_df, function(x){
  cor(risk_numeric, x, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
})
# Create a data frame from the correlation results
corr_df <- data.frame(Variable = names(Risk_correlations), spearman_correlation = round(Risk_correlations, 3))
# Set scale limits for heatmap
min_val <- min(corr_df$spearman_correlation)
max_val <- max(corr_df$spearman_correlation)
#Plot Heatmap to show the correlations
ggplot(corr_df, aes(x = reorder(Variable, spearman_correlation),
                    y = "Risk Rating",fill = spearman_correlation)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(spearman_correlation, 2)),color = "black", size = 4, fontface = "bold") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "yellow", mid = "blue", high = "orange",
                       midpoint = 0, limits = c(min_val, max_val),name = "Spearman\nCorrelation") +
  labs(title = "Correlation of Risk Rating with Numerical Features",x = "Variables", y = "") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, face = "bold"),plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))

```



In Above Correlations matrixs we have seen that there is no individual relationship between numerical variables and also with the target variable.


## 2.4    Boxplots 
Evaluate how effectively each numeric characteristic distinguishes between the Risk Rating categories and examine the occurrence of outliers in the dataset using boxplots.
```{r}
numeric_vars <- c("Age", "Income", "Credit.Score", "Loan.Amount", "Years.at.Current.Job", 
                  "Debt.to.Income.Ratio", "Assets.Value", "Number.of.Dependents", "Previous.Defaults", "Marital.Status.Change")
for (var in numeric_vars) {
  print(
    ggplot(financial_df, aes(x=Risk.Rating, y=.data[[var]], fill=Risk.Rating)) +
      geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = 16, outlier.color = "red") +
      theme_minimal() +
      labs(title=paste("Boxplot of", var, "by Risk Rating"), 
           x="Risk Rating", y=var)
  )
}
```


## 2.5 PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS 

Perform Principal Component Analysis on the entire dataset while excluding the target variable (Risk.Rating) by utilizing One Hot Encoding. PCA necessitates numeric data since it relies on the covariance structure of the dataset.Perform Principal Component Analysis on the entire dataset while excluding the target variable (Risk.Rating) by utilizing One Hot Encoding. PCA necessitates numeric data since it relies on the covariance structure of the dataset. Since our dataset contains categorical (factor) variables, One Hot Encoding is applied to convert these into binary numeric columns. Although this increases the number of features, PCA will reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.
```{r}
# Create dummy encoder for all predictors (excluding target)
dummies <- dummyVars(~ ., data = financial_df[, names(financial_df) != "Risk.Rating"])

# Apply transformation
financial_encoded <- predict(dummies, newdata = financial_df)

# Convert to dataframe
financial_encoded_df <- as.data.frame(financial_encoded)

#Standardizing the data so that all variables contribute equally.
scaled_df <- scale(financial_encoded_df)

#Apply PCA
pca_result <- prcomp(scaled_df, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

# View summary of PCA
summary(pca_result)
```

```{r}
# Take first 2  principal components
pca_df <- as.data.frame(pca_result$x[, 1:2])  # PC1 and PC2
pca_df$Risk.Rating <- financial_df$Risk.Rating
str(pca_df)
```

```{r}
#plotting the result of pca1 & pca2 over the acutal target variable(Risk.Rating)
ggplot(pca_df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Risk.Rating)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "PCA Result After One-Hot Encoded Variables",
       x = "Principal Component 1",
       y = "Principal Component 2") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))
```

```{r}
###  calculate the proportion of explained variance (PEV) from the std values
pca_variance <- pca_result$sdev^2
pca_var_percent <- round(pca_variance / sum(pca_variance) * 100, 1)

barplot(pca_var_percent,
        names.arg = paste0("PC", 1:length(pca_var_percent)),
        main = "Explained Variance by Principal Component",
        xlab = "Principal Components", ylab = "Variance Explained (%)",
        col = "lightblue")
```

```{r}
###  plot the cumulative PEV
{
plot(cumsum(pca_var_percent), type = "b", pch = 19,
     xlab = "Number of Principal Components",
     ylab = "Cumulative Variance Explained (%)",
     main = "Cumulative Explained Variance")
}
```

```{r}
#Plot PC1 Loadings 
pca1_loadings <- pca_result$rotation[, 1]
variable <- rownames(pca_result$rotation)

# Create a dataframe
loadings_df <- data.frame(
  Variables = variable,
  Loading = pca1_loadings,
  Label = variable
)

p <- ggplot(loadings_df, aes(x = reorder(Label, Loading), y = Loading,
                             text = paste(Variables, "<br>Loading:", round(Loading, 3)))) +
  geom_col(fill = "red") +
  labs(title = "PC1 Loadings",x = "PC1",y = "Loadings Value") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, face = "bold"))

#add message on hover when user hover on the bar it sees message shows variable name and loading value by using ggplotly library 
interactive_plot <- ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text")
interactive_plot


```



As each principal component contributes equally and maintains all the variance, we cannot lower the dimensionality by eliminating any components. If we are required to keep all the components, then utilizing PCA does not offer any advantages. In simpler terms, PCA does not succeed in uncovering any lower-dimensional patterns in the data. Hence, we will look into another unsupervised method â€” clustering.


## 2.6 CLUSTERING
## 2.6.1   we use 2 different approaches of clustering to see which one is best fits on our dataset to finds the hidden patterns
### One is Hierarchical clustering and other one is Kmeans clustering 
```{r}

# Use Hierarchical cluster
financial_dist <- dist(financial_encoded_df, method = 'euclidian')
hierarchical_clust <- hclust(financial_dist, method = "complete")

#plot the Dendrogram 
plot(hierarchical_clust, hang = -0.1, labels = FALSE, main = "Hierarchical Clustering with Euclidian Distance")

#Select the clusters 
Reduce_clust_levels <- cutree(hierarchical_clust, k = 3)

#Check each cluster values count 
table(Reduce_clust_levels)

#contengency table 
table(Cluster = Reduce_clust_levels, RiskRating = financial_df$Risk.Rating)

# Use K-Mean clustering
kmeans_result <- kmeans(financial_encoded_df, 3)
k_cluster_id <- kmeans_result$cluster

# calculate the score 
hc_cluster_sil <- cluster::silhouette(Reduce_clust_levels, financial_dist)
kmean_cluster_sil <- cluster::silhouette(k_cluster_id, financial_dist)

# plot the results of the silhoutte analysis for the two cluster solutions
opar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot(hc_cluster_sil)
plot(kmean_cluster_sil)
par(opar)

```




We utilized two clustering techniques: Hierarchical clustering and K-means. While the overall silhouette score for K-means was average (0.45), it outperformed hierarchical clustering, suggesting that there may be some underlying group structures present in the data.. Therefore, we decided to use the K-means cluster assignments as an additional feature in our dataset. A new version of the dataset was created with this cluster label appended, and we trained a Random Forest model on it to evaluate whether incorporating this hidden grouping information could enhance classification performance compared to the original model.


### 3 MODELING PHASE 

I commence the modeling phase by employing the Random Forest Model, which has been chosen for this project due to its reliability as a non-parametric ensemble method that excels with both numerical and categorical data. It is capable of managing large datasets, minimizes the chances of overfitting, and improves model interpretability by highlighting significant features through its bagging approach. Additionally, it performs well in problems like this one that involve imbalanced classification, especially when combined with techniques like stratified sampling.


```{r}
#Transfer actual dataset into new Variable
Cluster_feature_dataset <- financial_df

#Add Cluster Data as New Feature into dataset 
Cluster_feature_dataset$Cluster <- as.factor(k_cluster_id)
str(Cluster_feature_dataset)

# set random seed
set.seed(1999)
#split data into 70/30 for training/testing
n_rows <- nrow(Cluster_feature_dataset)
# sample 70% (n_rows * 0.7) indices in the ranges 1:nrows
train_test_index <- sample(n_rows, n_rows * 0.7)
# filter the data frame with the training indices (and the complement)
train_to_data <- Cluster_feature_dataset[train_test_index,]
test_to_data <- Cluster_feature_dataset[-train_test_index,]

#Before training make sure that target variable is a factor
train_to_data$Risk.Rating <- as.factor(train_to_data$Risk.Rating)

# this build a strong model using a 200 trees
Cluster_rf_train <- randomForest(Risk.Rating ~ ., data = train_to_data, ntree = 200, importance = TRUE)

# plot the error rates
{plot(Cluster_rf_train)
legend('topright', colnames(Cluster_rf_train$err.rate), bty = 'n', lty = c(1,2,3), col = c(1:3))}

# plot the variable importancea according to the
varImpPlot(Cluster_rf_train, type = 1)
```

```{r}
# compute the prediction for the random forest model
Cluster_rf_test <- predict(Cluster_rf_train, test_to_data, type = "class")
```

```{r}
# create a contingency table for the actual VS predicted for the random forest model
rf_result_table <- table(predicted = Cluster_rf_test, actual = test_to_data$Risk.Rating)
rf_result_table
```

```{r}
# Confusion matrix
conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(Cluster_rf_test, test_to_data$Risk.Rating)
print(conf_matrix)

```


A Random Forest model was applied using real dataset information, which included the cluster grouping data generated through K-means clustering. The resulting model demonstrated subpar predictive performance, with an accuracy of 0.5884 and a Kappa score of -0.0035. Incorporating the cluster information into the model turned out to be unhelpful, as it resulted in worse outcomes and possibly introduced additional data noise. The model struggles to learn significant patterns from High and Medium risk classes because the actual dataset contains an extreme class imbalance. Building a fresh model with the original dataset but omitting the Cluster feature gained our attention to determine its effects on accuracy stability.

## 3.1 Using Simple Random Forest Model on Actual Dataset
## 3.1.1 Training + Testing

```{r}
# set random seed
set.seed(1999)
#split data into 70/30 for training/testing
n_rows <- nrow(financial_df)
# sample 70% (n_rows * 0.7) indices in the ranges 1:nrows
training_index <- sample(n_rows, n_rows * 0.7)
# filter the data frame with the training indices (and the complement)
train_data <- financial_df[training_index,]
test_data <- financial_df[-training_index,]

#Before training make sure that target variable is a factor
train_data$Risk.Rating <- as.factor(train_data$Risk.Rating)

start_time <- Sys.time()

# this build a strong model using a 200 trees
rf_train <- randomForest(Risk.Rating ~ ., data = train_data, ntree = 200, importance = TRUE)

end_time <- Sys.time()

# plot the error rates
{plot(rf_train)
legend('topright', colnames(rf_train$err.rate), bty = 'n', lty = c(1,2,3), col = c(1:3))}

# plot the variable importancea according to the
varImpPlot(rf_train, type = 1)
```
```{r}
# Calculate time difference
training_duration <- end_time - start_time
print(training_duration)
```

## 3.1.2 Prediction

```{r}
# compute the prediction for the random forest model
rf_test <- predict(rf_train, test_data, type = "class")
```


## 3.1.3 Performance Evaluation
```{r}
# create a contingency table for the actual VS predicted for the random forest model
rf_result_table <- table(predicted = rf_test, actual = test_data$Risk.Rating)
rf_result_table
```

```{r}
# Confusion matrix
conf_matrix <- confusionMatrix(rf_test, test_data$Risk.Rating)
print(conf_matrix)
```

```{r}
# calculate accuracy from each contigency table
#   as sum of diagonal elements over sum of the matrix values
acc_rf <- sum(diag(rf_result_table)) / sum(rf_result_table)
acc_rf
```



The information provided shows that the standard Random Forest model is not achieving satisfactory performance. Besides neglecting the minority classes (High and Medium), the model's accuracy and Kappa score are still low, suggesting it is struggling to effectively recognize the underrepresented classes. Furthermore, a model trained on the actual dataset without the Cluster feature showed no improvement, with accuracy and Kappa scores nearly identical to the model that included the cluster feature. The analysis indicates that the clustering approach added no value to predictive capability. We will use stratified sampling and SMOTE sampling for addressing the ongoing class imbalance problem. The Random Forest model will receive improvements through integrating stratified sampling and SMOTE sampling while employing 5-fold cross-validation and 200 trees to enhance generalization and identify minority class instances accurately.


## 3.2 Employing Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning on stratified sampling ensures that the Risk Rating variable is proportionally divided between the training and testing datasets. Additionally, SMOTE will generate realistic data to balance the minority classes during the training phase, allowing for improved model training.

# 3.2.1 Training + Tuning 
```{r}
# set random seed
set.seed(1999)
# Use Stratified sampling so that each Risk Rating class is proportionally represented in both training and testing sets.
split_Data <- createDataPartition(financial_df$Risk.Rating, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
training_data <- financial_df[split_Data, ]
testing_data  <- financial_df[-split_Data, ]

# Define control method with cross-validation
ctrl_parameters <- trainControl(method = 'CV', number = 5, sampling = "smote", classProbs = TRUE, summaryFunction = multiClassSummary)

# Define tuning grid
tune_grid <- expand.grid(.mtry = c(2, 4, 6, 8,12,15))

# check the tunable parameter available for rf
modelLookup('rf')

# train a Random forests model using caret train function
risk_rf <- train(Risk.Rating ~ ., data = training_data, method = "rf", metric = "Kappa", tuneGrid = tune_grid, 
                  trControl = ctrl_parameters, ntree = 200)
print(risk_rf)
plot(risk_rf)
```

## 3.2.2 Prediction
```{r}

  actual = testing_data$Risk.Rating,
  predicted = predict(risk_rf, testing_data[,-17], type = 'raw'),

)
```


## 3.2.3 Performance Evaluation
```{r}

The performance assessment primarily used accuracy combined with precision measurements together with confusion matrix results to measure prediction accuracy for classes. Detection of high-risk defaulters  proved challenging for the model as it produced fewer predictions in this category while maintaining accurate results for both Low and Medium cases.

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was used to perform training data balancing. Training with improved class distribution led to greater model performance however it continued to display weak performance on the "High" class in the test results as model bias mainly focused on the majority classes.

The evaluation procedure revealed both strengths along with weaknesses of the model including its tendency to respond differently to class balance issues. Future developments in the model will either evaluate threshold settings or conduct feature reengineering work or establish class-weighted approaches to enhance efficiency for marginal classes.
